## Reports on Task Assignment (Camunda 8 SaaS and SM)
The first iteration of this feature brings back existing features from Camunda 7 to Camunda 8. It is now possible to aggregate the duration of User Tasks in the states “Assigned” and “Unassigned” for a “User Task” / “Assignee”. The evaluation per “Assignee” is only possible for Camunda SM and can be switched off via a configuration. Have a look at the new options in the User Task Report now.

## Build custom adoption reports
It is now possible to build reports evaluating up to 1024 data sources. This feature allows flexible evaluations across all processes to measure the adoption of specific patterns and process orchestration overall.

## Copy reports on dashboards
Duplicate reports easily directly on the dashboard. The new feature copies the selected report with all configurations and allows it to be positioned freely on the dashboard. This allows you to compare different data sets using the same report configuration quickly. Copying is not possible only for reports, but also for all other tiles on the dashboard.
