## Management Dashboard

When you have 15 different processes, where do you focus your efforts? How do you gain a holistic picture? Do you look at 15 different dashboards, or do you create and manage a full set of multi-process dashboards?
We’re offering a solution for this problem with the Management Dashboard. It’s a standard dashboard that integrates data from all your processes.

## KPI Overview

Optimize 3.8 introduced the ability to set business goals on a limited number of metrics. This release renames business goals to KPIs and lets you create a KPI based on almost any report visualized as a number (variable number reports aren’t supported yet).

## Process Onboarding UX (C8SaaS only)

Whenever the first process instance of a new process definition is deployed, the user will receive an email with an invitation to create a first default dashboard in Optimize.

## Process Digest (C8SaaS & C7 Enterprise only)

Alerts are useful if you want to monitor critical KPIs for immediate intervention. However, how do you track all your KPIs and share them with stakeholders? The new process digest feature gives you a weekly email.

## Limiting who can export (C7 Enterprise only)

Prior to this release, all users have been able to export Reports and Outlier Analyses as CSV files. Now Optimize allows you to restrict this option, or to only allow this for superusers, giving you full control over which users can export data from Optimize.

## Restrict report and dashboard creation to collections (C7 Enterprise only)

Optimize is structured with entities like reports and dashboards that are created inside and outside of collections. With more and more users creating these entities, this can get messy and hard to govern. With this release, it is now possible to limit “entity-authorized-editors”. These users are the only ones which are authorized to create, edit, copy and delete Optimize entities outside of a collection.
