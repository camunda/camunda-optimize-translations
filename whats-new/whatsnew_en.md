## Carbon Design migration (All distributions)

We are in the process of migrating Camunda Optimize UI to use the Carbon Design System. Our primary focus is to bring the Optimize UI in line with other Camunda products, providing a consistent and seamless experience across the entire ecosystem. With this migration, we will also adhere to accessibility best practices, ensuring that our application is usable by a broader range of users.

The migration to the Carbon Design System for Camunda Optimize is an ongoing effort. We have successfully migrated modals, tables, and popovers, ensuring these components seamlessly integrate into the new design. While the functionality you love remains intact, you can expect a refreshing new UI that aligns with the Carbon Design System.

## Improved Task Analytics (aka Outlier Analyses)

The updated Outlier Analysis is renamed to Task Analytics, as Outlier Analysis is one way to improve task execution. It is now possible to filter the set of process instances that are evaluated with the same extensive feature set as for the branch analyses. The resulting outliers with significant variables listed are displayed in a table below the diagram ordered by the task causing the highest impact. The table also allows the user to drill down to analyze the details of the outlier.

## Alerts and Email digest for Camunda 8 - Optimize self-managed
