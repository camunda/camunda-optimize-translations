## Carbon Design migration (All distributions)

We are in the process of migrating Camunda Optimize UI to use the Carbon Design System. Our primary focus is to bring the Optimize UI in line with other Camunda products, providing a consistent and seamless experience across the entire ecosystem. With this migration, we will also adhere to accessibility best practices, ensuring that our application is usable by a broader range of users.

The migration to the Carbon Design System for Camunda Optimize is an ongoing effort. We have successfully migrated modals, tables, and popovers, ensuring these components seamlessly integrate into the new design. While the functionality you love remains intact, you can expect a refreshing new UI that aligns with the Carbon Design System.

The updated Task Analysis now includes a revamped outliers table, offering enhanced insights into your processes. This table provides detailed information about outlier process instances, including the number of instances and related variables. For even more in-depth details, you can explore the modal, which showcases outliers on the duration chart and in the table.
